# Plan for upcoming months 2024

- Design a Landing Page:
  - [ ] Okay, so as you know the first thing users visit is the landing page. So, we need to decide on a design of the page. I am thinking of getting the design and try to use 3d model's in it to make it more attractive.
- Changes from Backend & Frontend:
  - [ ] Add support for country based input. So, like if some one is from USA then they should be able to see social security number and so.
- Research:
  - [ ] Need research work on how to add the support for generating QR for licenses of users eg: ZKP for Driving license.
  - [ ] Need research work on existing platforms which we can utilize to make system more robust eg: Anon Aadhar
  - [ ] Need research work on building new application that can utilize zeroID to fullest
